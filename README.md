https://github.com/awestlund/GymGuide506/ (our repository is public)

Step 2: Checkout branch called master with tag iteration_2 on within GitHub repository 
https://github.com/awestlund/GymGuide506/tree/master
  Here is the Iteration 2 tag: https://github.com/awestlund/GymGuide506/releases/tag/iteration_2

Step 3: Build project and verify there are no issues when building

Step 4: Run app on an emulator or Android device
  This will allow you to use the different features
  You will need a QR code to test out the QR scanning features
  You can test the text input for exercises using the different ID’s listed below. (This feature is built within the Scan QR Code button)

Step 5: In order to run tests you can either choose the run configuration to run the unit tests, or you can click on the small green circle on the left within CreateAccountActivityTest and LoginActivityTest within com.example.gymguide (test).  Make sure you are in the correct folder because com.example.gymguide (androidTest) does not contain our unit test files.

In Order to Automate Tests:
 On the drop down button next to the play button (Usually says “app”). Click on “Edit Configurations”.
 If not already selected, in the left panel click “Android Application” > “App”.
 In the “Before launch” box, click the plus button. Select “Another configuration” and then select “All app”. Click “Ok” on everything after.
 
Step 6:  In order to run tests you can either choose the run configuration to run the UI tests, or you can click on the small green circle on the left within CreateAccountActivityUITest and LoginActivityUITest within com.example.gymguide (androidTest).    Make sure you are in the correct folder because com.example.gymguide (test) does not contain our UI test files.
